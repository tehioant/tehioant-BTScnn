This file describes the organization of the original BCDR database (as downloaded from bcdr.inegi.up.pt)

Notation:
DDD: Dataset D01, D02 or DN01
PPP: Patient number (with no padding)
SSS: Number of the study (with no padding)
XXX: Series number. Almost always 1.
MMM: Type of mammogram LO, LCC, RO, RCC

----- ORGANIZATION OF MAMMOGRAMS ----
Mammograms are ordered in a hierarchy
 \BCDR-DDD_dataset
	\patient_PPP
		\study_SSS
			image_PPP_SSS_XXX_MMM.tif


Some mammograms appear in more than one dataset (same patient and study in two places but with different lessions)

------ ORGANIZATION OF INFO ----------------
There are some comma-separated-values files inside each BCDR-DDD_dataset folder which offer info on the lesions and patients.

1. bcdr_DDD_outlines.csv
	It contains the info and outline of each lession
		patient_id (same as PPP)
		study_id (same as SSS)
		series (same as XXX)
		lesion_id (unique per lession in the two image views (CC and O) and two datasets, but changes with studies and series)
		segmentation_id (changes per outline, same lession can have different segmentations (2) in different image views and different datasets)
		image_view (1 for RCC, 2 for LCC, 3 for RO and 4 for LO)
		image_filename (such as 'patient_3/study_4/img_3_4_1_LO.tif')
		lw_x_points (space separated x-coordenates of the outline, they do not start and end in same point)
		lw_y_points (space separated y-coordenates of the outline, they do not start and end in same point)
		mammography_type (boolean, indicates whether a lession is present, always 1)
		mammography_nodule (boolean, is lesion a mass?, always 1 in BCDR-D01)
		mammography_calcification (boolean, is lesion a calcification?, in BCDR-D02, either this is 1 or mammography_microcalcification is 1)
		mammography_microcalcification (boolean, is lesion a calcification?, in BCDR-D02, either this is 1 or mammography_calcification is 1)
		mammography_axiliary_adenopathy (boolean, is lesion an axiliary adenopathy?, always 0)
		mammography_architectural_distortion (boolean, is there an architectural distortion?)
		mammography_stroma_distortion (boolean, is there an stroma distortion?)
		age (patient's age when study was made)
		classification (Lession biopsy result: 'Benign' or 'Malign')

One lesion can appear in the two datasets once as a mass and once as a microcalcification (lesion_id, segmentation_id and therefore outline are preserved).
There are mammograms with no lesion as well as mammograms with more than one lession.

2. bcdr_DDD_img.csv
	It contains some clinical and bookkeeping info. Same info as in outlines.
		patient_id (same as PPP)
		study_id (same as SSS)
		series (same as XXX)
		image_filename (such as 'patient_3/study_4/img_3_4_1_LO.tif')
		image_type_name (same as MMM)
		image_type_id (0 for RCC, 1 for LCC, 2 for RO and 3 for LO)
		age (Patient age when study was made)
		density (Breast density)

3. bcdr_DDD_features.csv
	It contains some precomputed image features. Not needed for us.
