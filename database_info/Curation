I manually inspected all mammograms to check for mammograms who are odd or were poorly taken. I enlist here all I have deleted; the _img and _outlines file are updated to reflect the changes

Patient	| Right/Left 
30	Both
65	Both
118	Right
129	Implants
183 	Left
329	Both
470	Both
511	Implants

I also generated a  lesion mask for each remaining image.
