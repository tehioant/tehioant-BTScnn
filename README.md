## Usage
### Data set
1. You can obtain the BCDR database [online](http://bcdr.inegi.up.pt/) ([Moura et al.](http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11548-013-0838-2)). I used the BCDR-DO1 data set, this one has around 70 patients(~300 digital mammograms) with breast masses and their lesion outlines. [fileOrganization](database_info/file_Organization) has some info on how is this images ordered.

2. To obtain the masks (from the outlines provided in the database) you can use [createMasks.m](database_info/createMask/createMask.m). This reads the mammogram info from a couple of files provided in the database: [sample bcdr_d01_img.csv](database_info/createMask/bcdr_d01_img.csv) and [sample bcdr_d01_outlines.csv](database_info/createMask/bcdr_d01_outlines.csv)

   Output should look like this:  
   <img src="database_info/createMask/img_20_30_1_RCC.png" width="250"/> <img src="database_info/createMask/img_20_30_1_RCC_mask.png" width="250"/>

3. Use [prepareDB](code/prepareDB.py) to enhance the contrast of the mammograms and downsample them to have a manageable size (2cmx2cm in the mammogram in 128x128).

   Output looks like this:  
   <img src="docs/report/plots/mammogram_resized.png" width="250" align='center'>

4. Finally you would need to divide the dataset into training, validation and test patients. You would need to produce a .csv with image and label filenames as [this](code/example.csv) for each set.

### Training
1. You would need to [install Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/)
2. Run [train](code/train.py) or [train_with_val_split](code/train_with_val_split.py) to train networks. These train the network defined in [model_v3](code/model_v3.py), a fully convolutional network with 10 layers (900K parameters) that uses dillated convolution and is modelled in a ResNet network. Training is done image by image (no batch, but cost is computed in every pixel of the thousand of pixels) and uses dropout among other things
    Note: Code was written for tensorflow 1.11.0 so it would need to be modified to make work in tf1.0

### Evaluation
1. You can use [compute_metrics](code/compute_metrics.py) or [compute_FROC](code/compute_FROC.py) to compute evaluation metrics or the FROC curve.

You are invited to check the code for more details, I tried to document it nicely.
