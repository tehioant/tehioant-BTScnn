\section{Summary}
Machine learning studies mathematical models and the algorithms used to estimate their parameters from data. A machine learning model especially suited to images, convolutional networks, has produced state-of-the-art results in a variety of computer vision tasks, including image segmentation---assigning a class to each pixel in an image.
%Training big convolutional networks from little data, however, involves many practicalities.
Breast cancer detection can be framed as segmentation by assigning breast cancer lesions (breast masses and microcalcifications) to the positive class and normal breast tissue to the negative class; convolutional networks can then be used to separate lesions from normal breast tissue. Use of convolutional networks for similar tasks has been reported in the literature but this work will be the first report of end-to-end lesion segmentation.
