Breast cancer is one of the most common and deadliest cancer in women.
However, early detection increases chances of survival to virtually 100\%.
Radiologists use mammograms, x-ray pictures of the breast, to look for signs of tumor formation such as microcalcifications and breast masses.
We aim to detect these signs using convolutional networks, a modern machine learning model that performs image segmentation in a single learnable step. After testing different network architectures and training configurations, we showed that convolutional networks are able to segment breast cancer lesions with promising results. Furthermore, this performance will only improve as richer data sets become available. We highly encourage research in this direction.
