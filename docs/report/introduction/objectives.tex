The main goal of this work is to use convolutional networks to segment breast cancer lesions in digital mammograms and measure how different architectural decisions affect performance. % the effect on performance of different architectural decisions. %and compare our results with those obtained by groups doing similar work.
Particularly, there are various minor goals which we expect to achieve as the project advances:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Obtain and process the mammographic database to make it available for future research on campus.
	\item Develop software tools to handle the database and train new deep learning models.
	\item Analyze the performance of convolutional networks reported on the literature.
	\item Train a modern, fine-tuned convolutional network to perform lesion segmentation.
	\item Test the viability of convolutional networks for breast cancer detection and diagnosis.
%	\item Generate results that could produce a conference or journal article.
	\item Use alternative convolutional network models to improve results.
	\item Propose new ideas for future research in the topic.
\end{itemize}
